# Ansible Fundamentals Workshop 

Ansible is a simple yet powerful IT automation engine for application deployment, configuration management, and orchestration that you can learn quickly.

In the first section of this lab you will learn to use Ansible Engine for automation from the basics up to some more advanced concepts.

The second section of this lab covers Tower and provide the user an overview of what Tower is, how it works and what the benefit of it is.

The exercises are self explanatory and guide the particpants through the entire lab. All concepts are explained when they are introduced.
